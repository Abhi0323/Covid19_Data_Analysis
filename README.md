# Covid19_Data_Analysis

Welcome to my Covid 19 data analysis project! In this project, I have analyzed a dataset related to the Covid 19 pandemic, which has affected the world in an unprecedented manner.

My goal was to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis, explore the data using SQL queries, and create visually appealing and informative visualizations in Tableau. The following is a brief overview of my methodology and the findings of my analysis.

Data Cleaning in Excel:
Firstly, I obtained a raw dataset related to Covid 19 from a reliable source. Then, I performed extensive data cleaning in Excel.

Data Exploration in SQL:
Next, I imported the dataset into a SQL database and used SQL queries to explore the data. I was able to extract meaningful insights from the data by joining and filtering different tables in the database. I analyzed the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries in different countries and continents, and also looked at the trend of Covid 19 cases over time.

Visualization in Tableau:
Finally, I used Tableau to create interactive and visually appealing visualizations that summarized the insights gained from the data. I created multiple dashboards that showed the distribution of Covid 19 cases across the world, the mortality rate, and the trend of Covid 19 cases over time. I also created a map that displayed the number of cases in each country and continent.

In conclusion, this project showcases my skills in data cleaning, data exploration, and data visualization. The insights gained from this project could be used to understand the impact of Covid 19 on different countries and to help make informed decisions related to public health policies.
